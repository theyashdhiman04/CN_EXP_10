#### **Project Title:**
Network Topology Design for IPv4 and IPv6 Performance over 3G Mobile Networks

---

#### **Objective:**
This experiment aims to design and test a network topology that ensures scalability, fault tolerance, and high performance (low latency, high throughput, minimal packet loss) for both IPv4 and IPv6 protocols over 3G mobile networks. The network design will accommodate future growth, maintain service continuity during failures, and optimize performance for mobile devices.

#### **Equipment Used:**
- **Tools**: 
  - Command Prompt (for network diagnostics)
  - Cisco Packet Tracer (for network simulation)
- **Devices**: 
  - Mobile devices supporting both IPv4 and IPv6
  - Servers with dual-stack (IPv4 and IPv6) support
- **Hardware**: 
  - Personal Computer/Laptop (Windows 7 or higher, 3GB RAM, 320GB HDD)
- **Software**:
  - Cisco Packet Tracer v7.4 or higher
  - Wireshark (for packet capture and analysis)

#### **Network Topology Overview:**
- **Core Layer**: Redundant core routers and load balancers for high availability and traffic distribution.
- **Distribution Layer**: Access routers, firewalls, and security measures to manage traffic between mobile devices and servers.
- **Access Layer**: Mobile devices and servers, both configured with IPv4 and IPv6.
- **Backup Layer**: Redundant internet connections, backup servers, and failover mechanisms to ensure fault tolerance.
- **Performance Optimization**: Caching servers, content delivery networks (CDNs), and Quality of Service (QoS) for prioritizing traffic.

#### **Procedure:**

1. **Configure Devices for Dual-Stack**:
   - Set up the mobile device and server to support both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
   - Ensure that both protocols are active and configured correctly on all devices.

2. **Verify IPv4 and IPv6 Support**:
   - Test connectivity by pinging the server from the mobile device using both IPv4 and IPv6.
   - Verify that the 3G network supports both IPv4 and IPv6.

3. **Test IPv4 Connection**:
   - Establish an IPv4 connection between the mobile device and the server.
   - Perform network tests to measure **latency**, **throughput**, and **packet loss**.

4. **Monitor IPv4 Performance**:
   - Use tools like **ping** and **file transfer** to measure **latency** and **throughput**.
   - Capture and analyze packets for any signs of **packet loss** or network delays.

5. **Switch to IPv6-Only Mode**:
   - Change the mobile device to IPv6-only mode.
   - Ensure the connection is established with the server using IPv6.

6. **Test IPv6 Connection**:
   - Repeat **ping**, **file transfer**, and **packet loss** tests over IPv6 to assess performance.

7. **Capture Packets for Analysis**:
   - Use **Wireshark** to capture and analyze IPv4 and IPv6 packet headers.
   - Look for differences in header size, fragmentation, and routing efficiency.

8. **Compare IPv4 and IPv6 Performance**:
   - Compare test results between IPv4 and IPv6, focusing on **latency**, **throughput**, and **packet loss**.
   - Identify key differences in protocol performance.

9. **Simulate Network Failures**:
   - Disconnect network links or disable servers to simulate network failure.
   - Observe failover processes and measure recovery time and impact on performance.

10. **Evaluate Redundancy and Fault Tolerance**:
    - Test redundant systems (servers, paths) to ensure continuous service during failures.
    - Record performance degradation, if any, during the failover process.

11. **Analyze Load Balancing**:
    - Verify load balancing by sending multiple requests to the server.
    - Ensure traffic is distributed evenly and measure its impact on server load.

12. **Perform Final Performance Tests**:
    - After fault tolerance and redundancy tests, re-run **latency**, **throughput**, and **packet loss** tests.
    - Compare results before and after network failures.

13. **Document Results**:
    - Record all performance test results (latency, throughput, packet loss).
    - Provide detailed analysis of protocol performance, scalability, fault tolerance, and network reliability.

#### **Expected Output:**
1. **Latency**: Compare round-trip times for both IPv4 and IPv6.
2. **Throughput**: Measure file transfer speeds for IPv4 and IPv6 under different conditions.
3. **Packet Loss**: Analyze packet capture logs to identify and compare packet loss in IPv4 and IPv6 scenarios.
4. **Redundancy & Fault Tolerance**: Assess network performance during simulated failures and measure failover times.
5. **Performance Analysis**: Detailed analysis of how IPv6 outperforms IPv4, especially in large, optimized networks.

#### **Learning Outcomes:**
- Understand the differences in **latency**, **throughput**, and **packet loss** between IPv4 and IPv6.
- Gain practical knowledge of **network redundancy**, **fault tolerance**, and **scalability**.
- Learn how to design networks that balance **performance**, **reliability**, and **security**.
- Develop an understanding of the impact of **3G network limitations** on protocol performance.
- Analyze the **efficiency** of IPv6 over IPv4, especially in terms of routing, fragmentation, and overall network efficiency.

---

#### **Conclusion:**
This experiment provides a comprehensive understanding of **IPv4 and IPv6 performance** in a **3G mobile network** context. It highlights the strengths of **IPv6** in terms of scalability, efficiency, and fault tolerance. The hands-on procedure allows for a detailed comparison of both protocols and helps to optimize network design for **future growth** and **resilience**.

#### **Additional Notes:**
- Ensure that all devices are configured properly before conducting tests to avoid errors.
- Backup the configuration files and network setup in **Cisco Packet Tracer** to prevent loss of work.
- Use Wireshark or any similar packet capture tool for in-depth packet analysis.
